    <p>
      My dogs are all mixed breed dogs. They were adopted from local rescue
      organizations. Cooper is seven, Ruby is six, Carly and Blue are five, and
      Coal is three years old. The rescue I adopted Cooper and Blue from is a
      part of Angel Flights. This is our local chapter of Animal Rescue Flights.
      This service consists of volunteer pilots in Orlando, Florida who fly
      their private planes on the weekends to pick up puppies from high kill
      shelters in other states and bring them to Florida where the local rescue
      organizations can adopt them out.
